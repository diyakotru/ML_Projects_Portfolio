### 1. SMS Spam Detection
**Objective:**  
To classify SMS messages as *Spam* or *Ham* using machine learning.
**Techniques Used:**  
- Text preprocessing  
- TF-IDF Vectorization  
- Naive Bayes Classifier  
**Result:**  
The model achieves ~97–98% accuracy and correctly identifies spam messages.


### 2. Wine Quality Classification
**Objective:**  
To classify different types of wine based on their chemical properties.
**Techniques Used:**  
- Feature-based classification  
- Random Forest Classifier  
**Dataset:**  
Built-in Wine Dataset from scikit-learn (13 features, 3 classes)
**Result:**  
The model shows high accuracy and performs well on unseen data.
